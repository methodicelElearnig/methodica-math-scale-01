# Sending metadata to the Kata catalog

`send-metadata.ps1` pushes the `metadata/` folder (1 unit + 5 components + their
items) into the Katalog (Kata) catalog at `https://kata.cet.ac.il/api/v1`.
It **upserts**: for each entity it does a `GET` by uniqueKey, then `PATCH` if it
already exists or `POST` if it doesn't — so it's safe to run more than once.

See [KATA-API-DETAILED.md](../../KATA-API-DETAILED.md) for the full endpoint schemas.

## Requirements

- **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh`). The script declares `#Requires -Version 7.0` and will
  not run on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (needed for correct array + UTF-8 JSON handling).
- **curl.exe** — bundled with Windows 10/11.

## One-time setup

Get an API key from the Kata UI → **מפתחות API** (`/api-credentials`), then make it
available in any **one** of these ways — the script checks them in this order:

1. `-ApiKey '<key>'` on the command line.
2. The `KATA_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. **`kata-api-key.txt`** next to the script — one line, just the key. This is the
   usual choice; the file is git-ignored.

```powershell
# option 3, once:
'<your-key>' | Set-Content kata-api-key.txt -NoNewline
```

Outside `-DryRun` the script refuses to run when no key is found. The key is never
written to the log, and both scripts share the same file.

> **Never hard-code a key in the scripts** — unlike before, `send-metadata.ps1` and
> `retrieve-metadata.ps1` are committed. `kata-api-key.txt` is the only place a live key
> may sit on disk, and `.gitignore` excludes it.

## Usage

```powershell
# 1) Dry run — builds and prints every payload, no network, no key needed.
pwsh -File send-metadata.ps1 -DryRun

# 2) Live run — after setting up the key (see above).
pwsh -File send-metadata.ps1

# Optional overrides:
pwsh -File send-metadata.ps1 -BaseUrl 'https://kata.cet.ac.il' -MetadataDir '.\metadata'
```

Progress prints to the console and to `send-metadata.log` (git-ignored). Each line is
`CREATED` / `UPDATED` / `FAILED` with the HTTP status; the run ends with a
`created / updated / failed` summary and a non-zero exit code if anything failed.

## What the script does to the metadata

The metadata schema doesn't match the API 1:1, so the script transforms it. All of
this is controlled from the **CONFIG** block at the top of the file.

| Metadata | Sent to API |
|---|---|
| `id` (full URL) | `uniqueKey` = last path segment (slug), e.g. `methodica-math-scale-01-01` |
| unit `title` (string) | `title` object `{ "Hebrew": "…" }` (`$TitleLangKey`) |
| unit — (no manufacture) | `manufacture` = `'methodica'` (`$UnitManufacture`) |
| component — (missing) | `relativeDifficulty` falls back to component `order`; `depthLevel` to `core-curriculum-basic` — see `$ComponentOverrides` to force per-component values |
| component `manufacture` | dropped (owning group is derived from the API key) |
| item — (no order) | `order` = 1-based position in `subContent[]` |
| `questions[]` | passed through unchanged |

### Enums are kebab-case — no translation needed

Since the metadata was aligned to 720 v2.3 it stores the **same kebab-case vocabulary
the API uses** (`core-curriculum-basic`, `project-or-inquiry-task`,
`interactive-content`, `applying-a-model-or-procedure`, `state-general`, …), verified
live against the API on 2026-07-25. So values pass straight through and are only
*checked* against `$ValidContentType` / `$ValidMediaFormat` / `$ValidDepthLevel` /
`$ValidComponentPurpose` in CONFIG section (4).

> ⚠️ The Title Case tables in **`KATA-API.md` → "Controlled Vocabularies"** and in
> `KATA-API-DETAILED.md` are **stale** — the API neither returns nor accepts that form.

`$ComponentPurposeMap` / `$ContentTypeMap` / `$CognitiveLevelMap` now only rewrite
leftover **pre-v2.3** spellings (`ClassroomTask`, `Assessment`, `Analyzing`, …), which
current metadata no longer contains. Any value outside the API enums makes the script
**stop with an error** naming the offender rather than send bad data.

### `cognitiveLevel` — 8 of the 12 science levels are live (parts 04 and 05 still blocked)

KATA validates `cognitiveLevel` against a **per-discipline coded taxonomy**
(`GET /api/v1/cognitive-levels`). Those codes turned out to be kebab-case slugs
**identical to what the metadata stores**, so no mapping is required — the value passes
through and is checked against `$ValidCognitiveLevel`.

Verified live 2026-07-25: 12 codes exist, 8 `science` + 4 `mathematics`. The science
ones available are `identifying`, `describing`, `retrieving-information`,
`providing-examples`, `making-connections`, `interpreting`,
`applying-a-model-or-procedure`, `explaining`.

⚠️ Four of the 12 science levels in 720 v2.2 pp.17-18 are **still not loaded**:
`providing-scientific-reasoning`, `analyzing`, `synthesizing`,
`evaluating-and-justifying` (listed in `$PendingCognitiveLevel`). Parts **04**
(`analyzing`) and **05** (`evaluating-and-justifying`) therefore still stop the run with
an explicit message instead of taking a `422`. Parts 01–03 build fine. When MOE/CET
release the rest, move the code from `$PendingCognitiveLevel` into
`$ValidCognitiveLevel` and re-run. (See `docs/note-to-cet-science-cognitive-levels.md`.)

`depthLevel`, by contrast, is a **plain enum** (720 v2.2 p.16) and is read straight
from the metadata. `relativeDifficulty`, `depthLevel`, and `recommendedAfterFail` are
now all read from the metadata (not defaulted); `recommendedAfterFail` URLs are
reduced to component keys and may be forward references (see the note in
`New-ComponentBody`).

## Going the other way

[`retrieve-metadata.ps1`](RETRIEVE-METADATA.md) pulls a unit back out of the catalog
into `metadata-from/`, in this same file format, so you can diff the catalog against
the repo.

## Assumptions to verify on the first live run

Two mappings are best-guesses and isolated to single config points, so a first-call
`422` is a one-line fix:

1. **`uniqueKey` = URL slug.** If the catalog wants the full URL or a different
   format, change `Get-Slug` / the uniqueKey logic. (`GET /api/v1/content/next-unique-key?entityType=…`
   shows the catalog's expected format.)
2. **Unit `title` is an object** `{ "Hebrew": "…" }`. If rejected, adjust the
   title builder in `New-UnitBody`.

## Verify the result

- `GET /api/v1/content-units/methodica-math-scale-01` returns the unit with
  its components; spot-check `GET /api/v1/components/methodica-math-scale-01-01`
  and one item.
- In the Kata UI: **יחידות תוכן** (`/author`).
- Re-run once — every entity should report `UPDATED` (not duplicated).
